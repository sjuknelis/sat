It was long and narrow, with tables for two along the walls\", \"and tables for four down the middle. The decoration was art\", \"moderne, except for the series of murals depicting the four seasons,\", \"and the sick ferns in the front window. Lymie sat down at the\", \"second table from the cash register, and ordered his dinner. The\", \"history book, which he propped against the catsup and the glass\", \"sugar bowl, had been used by others before him. Blank pages front\", \"and back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic\", \"cartoons, and organs of the body; also with names and messages no\", \"longer clear and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other\", \"page there was some marginal notation, either in ink or in very\", \"hard pencil. And unless someone had upset a glass of water, the\", \"marks on page 177 were from tears.\", \"While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed on the\", \"thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and the Allied powers, his\", \"right hand managed again and again to bring food up to his mouth.\", \"Sometimes he chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food\", \"that he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of Vienna met,\", \"with some allowance for delays, early in November of the same\", \"year, and all the powers engaged in the war on either side sent\", \"plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and important\", \"assembly ever convoked to discuss and determine the affairs of\", \"Europe. The Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of\", \"Bavaria, Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in person at\", \"the court of the Emperor Francis I in the Austrian capital. When\", \"Lymie put down his fork and began to count them off, one by one,\", \"on the fingers of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma,\", \"thought he was through eating and tried to take his plate away. He\", \"stopped her.

The women had shingled hair and short tight\", \"skirts which exposed the underside of their knees when they sat\", \"down. One of the women had the face of a young boy but disguised\", \"by one trick or another (rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs\", \"plastered against the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent\", \"earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which as a matter of\", \"fact she was. The men were older. They laughed more than there\", \"seemed any occasion for, while they were deciding between soup\", \"and shrimp cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was the\", \"women\\u2019s voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch of the women\\u2019s\", \"voices which caused Lymie to skim over two whole pages without\", \"knowing what was on them. Fortunately he realized this and went\", \"back. Otherwise he might never have known about the secret treaty\", \"concluded between England, France, and Austria, when the\", \"pretensions of Prussia and Russia, acting in concert, seemed to\", \"threaten a renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress were\", \"stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at the top of page 68,\", \"but before Lymie got halfway through them, a coat that he\", \"recognized as his father\\u2019s was hung on the hook next to his chair.\", \"Lymie closed the book and said, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t think you were coming.\\u201d\", \"Time is probably no more unkind to sporting characters than it\", \"is to other people, but physical decay unsustained by respectability\", \"is somehow more noticeable.

He straightened his tie self-consciously and when Irma\", \"handed him a menu, he gestured with it so that the two women at\", \"the next table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth finger of\", \"his right hand. Both of these things, and also the fact that his hands\", \"showed signs of the manicurist, one can blame on the young man\", \"who had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of his head,\", \"and also sitting with a girl in the curve of the moon.
